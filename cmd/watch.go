	Use:   "watch",
	Short: "watch summarises new wrstat output",
	Long: `watch watches a wrstat output directory for new results and summarises them.

wr manager must have been started before running this. If the manager can run
commands on multiple nodes, be sure to set wr's ManagerHost config option to
the host you started the manager on.

This subcommand polls the given directory for new subdirectories matching the
following name format:

^[^_]+_.

That is, starting with some version string, an underscore, and then at least one
character of key data.

Once found, a summarise task will be launched via wr and it will be given the
stats.gz file in that directory.

The --output flag determines where the summarised data will be written. A new
subdirectory, named the same as the subdirectory containing the stats.gz file,
will be created to contain the new files.

The --quota and --config flags act the same as in the summarise subcommand and
will be passed along to it.
