## Analytics

There is a seperate analytics server (wrstat-ui analytics) that can be used to
view the analytics database generated by the wrstat-ui server.

This can be done manually by running the embed.sh script in the analytics
directory, or by running make build/install.

used to see how many system calls were performed in each run.

In addition, you can view any errors that were produced during the run.
