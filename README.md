# wrstat-ui

UI repo for [WRStat](https://github.com/wtsi-ssg/wrstat/)

## Build

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is required to build this project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/wrstat-ui/
cd wrstat
make
```

## Usage

Generally, use the `-h` option on wrstat and its sub commands for detailed
help.

## Analytics

There is a seperate analytics server (wrstat-ui analytics) that can be used to
view the analytics database generated by the wrstat-ui server.

When making changes to the frontend code (analytics/src) the changes will need
to be compiled for the production build.

This can be done manually by running the embed.sh script in the analytics
directory, or by running make build/install.

### Tools Required

The following commands are needed to run the analytics embed script:

```bash
npm install -g terser
go install vimagination.zapto.org/jspacker/cmd/jspacker
```
